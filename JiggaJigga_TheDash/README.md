Jigga Jigga: The Dash was the 2018-2019 installment of the Jigga Jigga competition at Proof School.
It consisted of betting an amount of money for a distance, which the highest bidder got to move one of their players that far.
My AI was sniperai.py, and my brother's was candlestickmaker.py. I got first place.
